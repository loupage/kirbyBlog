Text:

Whenever I create a theme, or even convert one like I did with this site, I like to test all the elements. This is a *kitchen sink* type of post with all the common html elements. 

This type of post should give you a good idea of what the all the different font styles look like in a theme.

Here are the styles for this site.

---

## A Paragraph

This is a paragraph of text which has all the most common html elements in it such as the **strong element** which is used to give text strong importance. You could of course use the <b>b element</b> which represents a span of text stylistically different from normal text, without conveying any special importance or relevance. The <mark>mark element</mark> which represents highlighted text, i.e., a run of text marked for reference purposes. *The HTML em element marks text that has stress emphasis.* You could of course use the <i>i element</i> which represents a range of text that is set off from the normal text for some reason, for example, technical terms, foreign language phrases, or fictional character thoughts. <i>It is typically displayed in italic type</i>.
