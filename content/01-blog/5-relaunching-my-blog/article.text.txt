My personal blog has been quiet now a couple of years now. While a good number of people followed my blog when I was posting regularly, but I turned my focus to social media outlet including [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/LouPage "Check out my Facebook Page.") and [Twitter](http://twitter.com/loupage "Follow me on Twitter.") and the blog languished. However, a recent project that required me to set up a blog in a new platform provided the needed motivation to kick off this blog again.

Setting up a blog is not terribly complicated, after all, I set up Wordpress sites for free. The harder part is to overcome the awkwardness of talking myself, committing to a regular schedule of posting, and positioning myself as a person who actually has something useful to say. 

Experience tells me that most everyone is an expert on something. [Niels Bohr](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niels_Bohr "Niels Bohr on Wikipedia"), Danish phyicist who made fundamental contributions to our understanding of atomic structure says,

>An expert is a man who has made all the mistakes which can be made, in a narrow field. - Niels Bohr

That definition resonates with me.  I plan to blog about practical ideas on leadership, productivity, and technology. Believe me, I have made my share of mistakes in each area.  But with mistakes comes learning, so perhaps my journey will help you avoid some of those mistakes.

So here I am, as Nike say, just doing it. I hope you will join me in the journey!
